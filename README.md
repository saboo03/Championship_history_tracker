## Problem Statement

Tracking the history of athletes and championship results has been a time-consuming and error-prone process. Sports organizations often rely on outdated systems or manual record-keeping, which leads to discrepancies and data loss. This makes it difficult to retrieve accurate information, analyze trends, or make data-driven decisions.

The **Championship History Tracker** aims to solve this problem by creating a centralized, digital repository for managing athletes and championship records. With automated data integrity checks and a user-friendly interface, this system will streamline the process of data entry, retrieval, and analysis, helping organizations keep an accurate and up-to-date record of historical data.
